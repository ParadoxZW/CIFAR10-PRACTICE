# CIFAR10 PRACTICE

Implementations of deep learning models to challenge cifar10 dataset, using PyTorch.
The implementation for network traing includes some kind of fancy tools,
like prefetch_generator, tqdm and tensorboardx.
I also use logging to print information into log file
rather than print function.
