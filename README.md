# CIFAR10 PRACTICE

An implementation of cnn model with fractional max pooling, using PyTorch. The model architecture is based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6071.pdf).this implementation includes some kind fancy tools,
like prefetch_generator, tqdm and tensorboardx.
I also use logging to print information into log file
rather than print function.
